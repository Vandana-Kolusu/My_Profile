# Hello, I'm Vandana, the Data Ninja 🥷

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀  
I’m a **Data Engineer** by day, and a **K-pop dance champion** by night. When I’m not transforming data into gold 🏆, I’m probably dancing to my favorite K-pop hits or analyzing how much time I've spent on YouTube watching dance covers... 3 hours? Who’s counting? 😅

## About Me

I take **data** as seriously as my K-pop playlist. 🎶  
Here’s a quick overview of my non-boring life:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **data pipelines** that flow smoother than my dance moves. 💃
- 🌱 Learning cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, because who doesn’t want to be the cloud king/queen? 👑
- 👯 Always ready to collaborate on data-driven projects, as long as there’s room for some K-pop references along the way.
- 📫 Reach out to me anytime at: [your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com) (I promise I won’t spam you with K-pop dance tutorials... unless you want them).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can calculate ETL times faster than I can memorize the latest K-pop choreography. 😎

## My GitHub Stats

You know what they say, "Data doesn't lie." So here's a few stats for you:

## My Most Used Languages (AKA My Favorite Dance Moves)

Here are the languages I speak fluently, both in code and on the dance floor:

## My Projects (and Dance Moves) 💻💃

These are my current **flagship projects** (don’t worry, they’re more polished than my dance moves on the first try).

### 1. [Real-Time Data Pipeline Masterpiece](https://github.com/Vandana/Project-1)
   - I built a **real-time data pipeline** that runs smoother than my first attempt at a K-pop choreography. (Spoiler: It was a mess)

### 2. [ETL Automation with Apache Airflow](https://github.com/Vandana/Project-2)
   - Automated ETL processes with **Apache Airflow**—now if only I could automate my dance rehearsals as efficiently. 😅

### 3. [Data Lake on AWS](https://github.com/Vandana/Project-3)
   - Set up a **data lake** on AWS, because who doesn’t love big data… and big storage? (I wish my dance collection was as organized!)

## Technologies I Use (And Sometimes Dance With)

Here’s what I’m working with, and no, I don’t dance with my laptop (usually):
